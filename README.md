# gestures-language



In order to reproduce the experiments, you would need:
1. Setup the environment - run conda env create -f enviroinment.yml
2. Download the data from here - https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10Y2JGFhXtV3cd1loC3kR_v4zlJMQ5Zng?usp=sharing
3. Train the gesture-language model

IF you don't want to train the model and just to play around with the embeddings, I also saved the train checkpoint. It can be downloaded from here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XzkyIjjn1rfOx2zjheyUGAgw1fN1k-KO/view?usp=sharing
